# Forecasting-Futures-Prices

In this project, I built a model for accurately forecasting the five futures prices, i.e., the five points in the volatility curve (VIXCM30, VIXCM60, VIXCM90, VIXCM120, VIXCM150). I also devised a metric for this exercise to evaluate the performance of my forecasting model. 

Following models were tested for this exercise:
1) ARCH/GARCH model
2) VECM Model
3) AR Models
4) ARMA Models
